# Life-Maze
A Conway's Game of Life Simulator 

## Why <em>Life-Maze</em>?

<strong>LifeMaze</strong> is a name that blends the concept of Conway's Game of Life with the idea of navigating through intricate and dynamic patterns, much like finding your way through a maze. The term "Life" directly refers to the Game of Life, while "Maze" adds a sense of complexity, exploration, and the challenge of discovering various patterns that can emerge within the cellular automaton. It suggests a journey of exploration and discovery within the evolving patterns of life, making it a fitting and evocative name for an app centered around Conway's Game of Life.
